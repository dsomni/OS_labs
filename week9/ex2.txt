Lets assume number of page frames is fixed. So fo ageing algorithm, we can increase
number of hits if we arrange same pages closer to each other (and closer than number of bits
used for counter). However, if we arrange same pages farther from each other,
number of hits will decrease.

You can run ex2i and ex2d to make sure about it.
ex2i uses inputI.txt and ex2d uses inputD.txt
There are the same datasets, but differently located.
So ex2i demonstrate increasing of hits, while ex2d shows decreasing
